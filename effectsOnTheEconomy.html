	The coronavirus has had an extremely large ripple effect on the economy. To avoid having people together in large groups, dine-in places like restaurants and bars closed first. The next commercial spaces that closed were retail stores, theaters, gymnasiums, fitness centers, recreation centers, and casinos. In the travel industry, airline and airport workers lost their jobs due to the lack of travelling. Additionally, hotel and resort owners had to shut down their hotels, so the people working for them lost their jobs. People everywhere started losing their jobs in industries one wouldn’t expect.There was a large ripple effect because jobs are all dependent on each other. For example, a hotel owner has to shut down her hotel and stops making money. This hotel owner hires a nanny to take care of her kids. If the hotel owner cannot pay for the nanny because her income has stopped, then the nanny is not getting any income either. As of May 14, 36.5 million Americans had filed unemployment claims. The problem with so many Americans being unemployed is that the unemployment benefit system is not made to handle so many unemployment claims. The system cannot calculate how much money each person should receive, so there is a set number for everyone. This amount of money is not enough for some, and it is more than enough for others, but people are still getting more than they would if they weren’t working. We are in an unprecedented, undoubtable recession. Our economic crisis will finally end when people regain the confidence to go out and continue their daily lives. If we go back to our normal practices too soon, we will reverse the progress we made in suppressing the virus.</p>
