	California has a pretty good situation considering that it is the most populated state in the United States. As of May 15, the US had 1,467,899 total cases. California had 75,040 total cases (about 5% of the total cases). There were 87,420 deaths in the US, but there were 3,054 deaths in California (about 3% of deaths out of the total deaths in the US). There were 318,964 recoveries in the US, but there were 12,595 recoveries in California (about 4% of the recoveries in the US). As of 2006, California made up about 12% of the US population. California had only 5% of total cases in the US, but makes up 12% of the US population. This shows the amount of cases is far fewer than one would predict based on the population of California.
