<h4>The Anne Frank House</h4>
<p>
	The Anne Frank House was established on 3 May 1957 in cooperation with Otto Frank, Anne Frank's father. We are an independent non-profit organisation that runs a museum in the house where Anne Frank went into hiding and we try to increase awareness of Anne's life story all over the world.
