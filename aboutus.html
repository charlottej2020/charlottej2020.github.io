<p id="body">Charlotte is a student at the Hamlin School. She is making this website for a tech assignment to practice her CSS. She got the idea to design her website around the coronavirus beause she is doing an interdisciplinary project focusing on COVID-19. She is doing research with her classmates to find out how COVID-19 affects the economy. </p>
