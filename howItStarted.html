The earliest coronavirus cases were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.  At first, they were just cases of pneumonia with an  unknown cause, but later it was confirmed that there was a new virus.  This virus most likely transferred from a bat to a human. Health officials in China were closely monitoring the situation to prevent an outbreak. They were not successful in keeping the cases contained, and it led to a world pandemic.</p>
